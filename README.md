# Zero-day-detection
Developed a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect zero-day attacks by analyzing network traffic patterns. Leveraged autoencoders and anomaly detection to distinguish normal from malicious activities, improving accuracy. Optimized for real-time detection, reducing false positives and enhancing scalability.
